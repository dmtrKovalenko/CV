Hello again! My name is Dmitriy, and I am a software engineer who truly loves his work! You may know me by my [public speaking engagements](#talks) or my contributions to amazing open source projects such as [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com), [Cypress.io](https://cypress.io), [react-native-community](https://github.com/react-native-community), and many others.

It's a pleasure to meet you here, and I hope you enjoy the design of this website.

By the way now I am actively working on [fframes](https://fframes.studio/) â€“ extremely fast declarive video creation framwork. [Check it out!](https://fframes.studio/)
