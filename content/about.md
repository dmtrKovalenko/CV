Hello again! My name is Dmitriy, and I am a software engineer with a passion to the open and fast! You may know me by my [public speaking](#talks) or my contributions to open source projects such as [odiff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff), [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com), [react-native](https://github.com/react-native-community), and many others. See [GitHub](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/).

By the way now I am ~~actively~~ working on [fframes](https://fframes.studio/) â€“ extremely fast declarive video creation framework in Rust.

It's a pleasure to meet you here, and I hope you enjoy **the design** of this website.
