Hello, another time! My name is Dmitriy and I am %TOKEN_AGE% y.o. software engineer from Ukraine. I've started my career when I was 17 as a trainee .Net developer. But then I tried javascript and absolutely fall in love with the front-end and javascript community at all. Then I continued my work as a JavaScript engineer outsource company, and now I am so proud that I can work full time for open source community ❤️, which I am really passionate about!

I am a core collaborator of [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/discover-more/team/) - the most popular UI kit for React in the world. Creator and main maintainer of [material-ui-pickers](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/) - set of date/time pickers for Material-UI. I've been working in the [awesome Cypress.io](https://cypress.io) company for a while. Also, member of react-native-community, maintaining [react-native-status-bar](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-statusbar), and some other popular and not so popular open-source projects. Just trying to make our software world a little bit better.

In short: speaker, holistic open-source contributor. Typescript/Ocaml, react and react-native fan. Also volleyball player and [amateur photographer](https://www.instagram.com/dmtr._.kovalenkoo/) (ᵔᴥᵔ)
