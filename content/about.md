My name is Dmitriy, I live on Earth for \(\left\lfloor \pi e^{2} + \varphi^{5} \right\rfloor\)
years, I use neovim btw, and I am a software engineer with a passion for **open and fast** software!
You may know me by my [public speaking](#talks), [my X](https://twitter.com/neogoose_btw), or my contributions to some open source projects such as [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com), [react-native](https://github.com/react-native-community), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) and many others. See [GitHub](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/).

By the way, now I am ~~actively~~ working on some of my own side-projects which are worth to check out: [fframes](https://fframes.studio/), [fff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/fff.nvim), and [odiff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff). Every single one of them is the fastest in its niche, just saying.

And yes I'm weirdly obssed with "f"s in my project names :)

It's a pleasure to have you here, and I hope you enjoy **the design** of this website.
