        My name is Dmitriy and this is my personal website, which I built using
        Material-UI long time ago when I was a{" "}
        <a href="https://mui.com/about/">core contributor</a>. To be honest, it
        is a true torture to write this page without Tailwind right now.
        <br /> I am <strong>a true fan</strong> of your work, use tailwind
        everywhere and would really love to help you ship ðŸš€ something truly
        amazing!

              I've been a Rustacean for a while. Currently, I'm working as a
              full- time Rust (and, of course, frontend with Tailwind) developer
              building with Rust. Besides that, I have a few Rust projects on my
              <a href="https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/"> GitHub</a> and am
              actively working{" "}
              <a href="https://fframes.studio">on a big Rust framework</a>{" "}
              (landing and devtools websites of fframes are using tailwind btw).

              Another one of my projects is{" "}
              <a href="https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff">ODiff</a>, which
              is the fastest diffing tool for images and is used by many visual
              regression services now. I built it because I wanted to make
              visual regression tests faster, and I did (yes, I'm really proud
              of it ðŸ«£). Also, I spend a lot of time optimizing video rendering
              and encoding, even committed a few patches to libav (the ffmpeg
              backend) which is a pure C and assembly codebase.
              <br />
              And overall, <strong>I truly love</strong> responsive, fast, and
              GPU-accelerated UIs so I usually spend tons of time polishing and
              optimizing my UIs (it's sometimes hard to do in startups though).

              When I was working on{" "}
              <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress.io</a>, we built a bunch
              of devtools, specifically dev server integrations with next.js,
              Vite, and webpack. So, I already have some experience integrating
              with existing frontend environments. And overall building devtools
              is one of my biggest passions, so I hope I know how to make
              developers happy.

              I understand how hard it is to create something that's genuinely
              useful, fast, helpful, and reliable all at once. That's why I

              better.

        I already have a ton of ideas on how we can make tailwind much better.
        Quick example: I recently had some issues with changing of the generated
        classnames order, I think it should be easy to make the order of classes
        guaranteed by tailwind so we don't have to worry about things{" "}
